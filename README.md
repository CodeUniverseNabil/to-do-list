Of course! I can help you write a README file for your Python routine manager program. I’ll make it clear, detailed, and professional so anyone can understand what it does and how to use it. Here’s a draft:

Routine Manager

A simple Python command-line program to manage your daily routine. You can create a new routine, add tasks, remove tasks, clear the routine, and view your current tasks along with the time spent.

Features

Create a New Routine: Start fresh by creating a new routine and entering your tasks.

Add Tasks: Add more tasks to your existing routine.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks one by one by specifying their number.

Clear Routine: Delete all tasks in your routine at once.

Show Routine: Display all tasks in the current routine with the time spent.

Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and crashes gracefully.
